### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am an aspiring data analyst or possibly junior data scientist who is currently located in Anaheim California, but am ready and willing to move anywhere in the United States or Mexico (I have dual citizenship) for solid job opportunities. Within data analytics, I consider my specialty, to the extent that I have one, is deeper knowledge of statistics, probability, and econometrics than most entry level peers of mine also looking to get their first foot on the ladder.

I have a Master of Science degree in Data Analytics Engineering from George Mason University, and most of my repositories on this profile were creating during group projects done for classes during that program, however, I have gone back to several of them and done more work and tinkering just for my own education and so I don't forget the skills I have learned. I like statistical learning, but I really only focus on logistic regression, clustering, lasso & enet, very simple neural networks, and ensemble methods (random forests mostly). I have a data science and economics blog where you can find articles I have written based on things I have learned from projects which are stored in repositories here.

The tools I know how to use are Microsoft Excell, Access, Power BI, Tableau, MySQL, R via RStudio, and Chat GPT.
